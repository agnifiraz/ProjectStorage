## EVERYONE HAS A GREAT CONTRIBUTION
### Just to clarify our work:
#### we used four buttons-> next, previous, new, update
#### First we need to press 'New' and we need to press 'Update' to update the data.
#### After some New(s), we can use 'next' and 'previous'.
#### When we press 'New', we don't need to save data. 'Update' button is only for updates.
#### When we press 'New', we get default values that are instructed in project instruction.
