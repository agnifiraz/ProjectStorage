            <p>I love writing blogs on recent tech news and updates in this modern world. Besides, I write blogs about society and culture. Bloggers are free thinkers, expressive, passionate, and excellent communicators. Sometimes, blogging also goes beyond necessary writing skills. It's an ability to share positive thoughts through well-structured language and stand up to ridicule is also a leadership quality. </p>

              <p>I am a tech-lover, and programming is my hobby. It is a hobby that requires both creativity and logical thinking. Although it takes many hours to master, for me, this is a reward once I can code effectively. Programming is the quintessential hobby for modern geeks, which has a potential career in the future.</p>

              <p> I am passionate about taking photographs of nature, society, culture, and people. Thanks to the innovation of smartphones, I can easily take pictures of my surrounding environment at any time I want.  I love the art of holding the camera and producing breathtaking images. A photographer has an eye for details, excellent photo opportunities, and also pay attention to details.</p>
